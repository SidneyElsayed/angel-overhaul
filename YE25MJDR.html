      Thank you for your gift to Angel Foundation™. As demand for our services
      continues to grow, you are helping families keep food on the table, a roof
      overhead, and gas in the tank amid the overwhelming financial impact of a
      cancer diagnosis. We are grateful to have you in our community of support,
      which has enabled Angel Foundation™ to distribute more than <strong>$15
      million</strong> in emergency financial assistance and provided more than
      <strong>58,000 services</strong> to individuals facing cancer since 2001.
      <em>Thank you.</em>
