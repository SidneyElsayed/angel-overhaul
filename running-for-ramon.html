      <p>My name is Ernesto Garcia, and I’m running my first marathon in honor
      of my dad, Ramon, who passed away in 2023. He taught me the importance of
      giving back, even in the hardest times.<br /><br />I have partnered with
      Angel Foundation™ to support families facing cancer, and I would be
      honored to have your support as I run in my dad's memory.</p>

      <p>My dad, Ramon Garcia, passed away from pancreatic cancer in August of
      2023. For me, running this marathon is bigger than just crossing a finish
      line; it is meant to honor the man who raised me, inspired me, and showed
      me what it means to live with heart.<br /><br />My dad battled cancer for
      over seven years. Even during the toughest moments, he never stopped
      smiling, never stopped giving. He was a leader in our Hispanic community
      here in Minnesota - hosting events, lifting people up, and always finding
      ways to give back.<br /><br />I learned a lot from my dad, but one of the
      biggest lessons he left me with was this: always give back. No matter what
      you are going through, there is always someone you can help. That mindset
      stuck with me, and it is what pushes me forward now.</p>

      <p>I have teamed up with Angel Foundation™ to raise money for families who
      are facing the same challenges we faced. Cancer affects more than just the
      patient - it impacts the whole family. Sometimes, having a little help can
      make all the difference. Angel Foundation™ offers just that - relief to
      adults with cancer and their loved ones through financial assistance,
      education, and emotional support.<br /><br />This run is for Ramon. For
      his strength, his love, his legacy. I am proud to be running for Ramon,
      and I would be honored to have your support along the way. Please consider
      a donation below.</p>
