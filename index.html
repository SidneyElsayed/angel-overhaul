      <p>Founded in 2001, Angel Foundation™ began by providing financial
      assistance to cancer patients for basic, nonmedical needs. We have since
      expanded to offer resource navigation, educational programs, financial
      guidance, social events for families, and therapeutic kits to help kids
      understand cancer and its treatment and more. Our goal is to be the
      premiere resource for cancer patients in Minnesota.</p>
