      <p>Founded in 2001, Angel Foundation™ began by providing financial
      assistance to cancer patients struggling to cover basic, nonmedical needs.
      Since then, we have expanded our offerings to include social events for
      families, therapeutic kits to help kids understand cancer and its
      treatment, educational programs, financial guidance, resource navigation,
      and more. Our goal is to be the premiere resource for cancer patients in
      Minnesota.</p>
