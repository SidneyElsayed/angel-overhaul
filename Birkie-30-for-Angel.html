      <p>This year, on February 20, me and Anna will once again be participating
      in the Birkie 30 km ski race. American Birkibeiner, or Birkie, is the
      largest cross-country ski race in the US. As part of this effort, we hope
      to raise funds to support the Angel Foundation.<br /><br />Angel
      Foundation provides vital relief to adults with cancer and their loved
      ones through financial assistance, education, and emotional support.
      Nearly every family in the U.S. is touched by cancer in one way or
      another, and the disease — along with its treatment — places an enormous
      emotional and financial burden on those affected.</p>

      <p>My father, Mikhail, lost a battle with lung cancer 3 years ago. He
      taught me the importance of working hard towards my goals and giving back
      to those in need. I would be honored to have your support as I ski in my
      dad's memory.</p>

      <p>Anna's mom, Yelena, succumbed to breast cancer also 3 years ago,
      leaving her family forever heart-broken. Anna too had a personal encounter
      with breast cancer a few years ago. She will be skiing in memory of her
      mom and to support all of the cancer patients in need.</p>
