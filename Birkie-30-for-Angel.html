      <p>This year, on February 20, me and Anna will once again be participating
      in the Birkie 30 km ski race. American Birkibeiner, or Birkie, is the
      largest cross-country ski race in the US. As part of this effort, we hope
      to raise funds to support the Angel Foundation.<br /><br />Angel
      Foundation provides vital relief to adults with cancer and their loved
      ones through financial assistance, education, and emotional support.
      Nearly every family in the U.S. is touched by cancer in one way or
      another, and the disease — along with its treatment — places an enormous
      emotional and financial burden on those affected.</p>

      <p>My father, Mikhail, lost a battle with lung cancer 3 years ago. He
      taught me the importance of working hard towards my goals and giving back
      to those in need. I would be honored to have your support as I ski in my
      dad's memory.</p>

      <p>I have teamed up with Angel Foundation™ to raise money for families who
      are facing the same challenges we faced. Cancer affects more than just the
      patient - it impacts the whole family. Sometimes, having a little help can
      make all the difference. Angel Foundation™ offers just that - relief to
      adults with cancer and their loved ones through financial assistance,
      education, and emotional support.<br /><br />This run is for Ramon. For
      his strength, his love, his legacy. I am proud to be running for Ramon,
      and I would be honored to have your support along the way. Please consider
      a donation below.</p>
