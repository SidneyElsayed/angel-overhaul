      Community partners, or “third parties,” who host events to benefit Angel
      Foundation™ are integral to our mission. Events can take any form that
      suits the host, such as birthday fundraisers, donation drives, or even a
      golf tournament. Third-party events are a great way to introduce your
      friends, family, and coworkers to Angel Foundation™ while raising money to
      benefit cancer patients.

      Each year, several of Angel Foundation’s™ community partners host
      <strong>Golf Tournaments</strong> to raise funds in support of our
      mission. These tournaments range from smaller events raising around
      $10,000 to large-scale events that raise $300,000 or more through
      registration fees, cash raffles, and live and silent auctions. Ames for
      Angel, Bearpath Ladies Golf League, Tri 4 Your Cure, and Sarah’s Scramble
      are just a few examples of events our supporters host each year to benefit
      Angel Foundation™.
