    question: What support do we offer children, preteens, and teens?
    answer_html: >-
      Children learn about cancer in age-appropriate and evidence-based programs
      and activities, such as Camp Angel, medical play sessions, and family
      retreats. These activities help children understand they can’t “catch”
      cancer like a cold or influenza, they didn’t cause their parent’s cancer
      by anything they did or said, and that it’s okay to cry. Children benefit
      from peer support with other kids who are going through a similar
      experience. Through Angel Foundation’s™ community of support, they see
      that they do not have to go through the cancer experience alone.
