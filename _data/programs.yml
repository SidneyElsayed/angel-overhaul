        question: What services do the Adult & Family Programs provide?
        answer_html: The Adult & Family Programs focus on how a parental cancer diagnosis affects the entire family. In addition to our in-person programming, we provide consultations and a variety of online resources to provide support for the whole family throughout all stages of the cancer experience.
        question: Who qualifies for Adult & Family Programs?
        answer_html: Adult & Family Programs are offered to Minnesota families with children, preteens, and teens who have a grown up in their life that has cancer. Program activities are provided free-of-charge, including those who do not qualify for Angel Foundation’s™ Emergency Financial Assistance program.
        question: How do we offer support to parents and caregivers?
        answer_html: Parenting through cancer can be difficult. Adult & Family programming and Angel Packs™ offer parents guidance on how to open up healthy lines of communication with their children; how to talk honestly about their diagnosis; and different behaviors that may manifest in their child. Parents are also encouraged to reflect on their own needs, identify reliable self-care techniques, and build a support network through interaction with other families who attend program activities.
        question: What support do we offer children, preteens, and teens?
        answer_html: Children learn about cancer in age-appropriate and evidence-based programs and activities, such as Camp Angel, medical play sessions, and family retreats. These activities help children understand they can’t “catch” cancer like a cold or influenza, they didn’t cause their parent’s cancer by anything they did or said, and that it’s okay to cry. Children benefit from peer support with other kids who are going through a similar experience. Through Angel Foundation’s™ community of support, they see that they do not have to go through the cancer experience alone.
