      Thank you again for the Gopher tickets! It was such a great game and a fun
      experience for our family. So much of the focus has been on me dealing
      with my cancer diagnosis and treatment, but my husband has taken care of
      me and kept our family functioning. Today, you helped fill his cup. I
      loved seeing him smile. Thank you!

      These Making Memories events are so helpful to families going through
      cancer. They provide amazing opportunities for us to get out, live life,
      and forget about cancer for a few hours.

      The Making Memories program has motivated me and my family to prioritize
      making memories together, even when I'm not feeling well. We are so
      grateful not to have to worry about financial concerns of social outings
      when so much else is uncertain.

      <p>Cancer can be all-consuming when you are feeling overwhelmed by nausea
      and fatigue. The Making Memories events allow for low-key family time and
      a chance to connect with others who are in the same situation. Thank
      you!</p>

      <p>Words cannot express how much that Emergency Financial Assistance grant
      made a difference in my life. I had already fallen behind on a couple of
      bills, causing me to feel stressed. Your grant took away the stress and
      gave me peace knowing that I was able to drastically lower the amounts I
      owed. Thank you for being there just when I needed you most.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for your help. It eased our stress to have rent
      covered for a month and be able to buy groceries. We really appreciate
      Angel Foundation™ and all you are doing to help people with cancer.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for offering the Financial Cancer Care Program. It
      took me getting diagnosed with brain cancer to really want to get serious
      about my finances. I am financially inexperienced, so this coaching has
      been an absolute blessing. I am 38 years old and have no savings
      whatsoever, but after participating in your program, I finally feel like I
      can change that.</p>

      <p>I would recommend the Financial Cancer Care workshop because cancer is
      completely overwhelming. Having guidance made me feel like I could move
      past some of the obstacles in my way. I am so grateful for the opportunity
      to meet with a Certified Financial Planner®, a resource that would not
      have been available to me otherwise. Thank you!</p>

      <p>The Financial Cancer Care Program taught me that I should not be
      embarrassed about my financial situation. The financial expert I met with
      experienced a similar situation to mine. I really felt like he wanted to
      help. He helped me find options for my mortgage, navigate insurance, and
      begin estate planning.</p>

      <p>My kids received their Angel Packs™ tonight and they were so
      appreciated. They opened them and read through all the books. They loved
      the activities! It was nice to see them excited and interested when there
      has been so much going on.</p>

      <p>When my husband started his cancer treatment, his provider gave our
      four children your wonderful Angel Packs™. What a great aid in helping
      explain, demonstrate, and reassure them. They loved Rory and held him
      close. We truly appreciate your mission.</p>

      <p>I think the Angel Packs™ meant a lot to my kids, because they had
      something that was just for them during those early weeks after my
      diagnosis. It was like they had someone looking out for them while their
      mom was busy, and having the kits tailored to different ages meant that my
      kids were getting information appropriate for each of them.</p>
