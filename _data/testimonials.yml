      "Thank you again for the Gopher tickets! It was such a great game and a
      fun experience for our family. So much of the focus has been on me dealing
      with my cancer diagnosis and treatment, but my husband has taken care of
      me and kept our family functioning. Today, you helped fill his cup. I
      loved seeing him smile. Thank you!"

      "These Making Memories events are so helpful to families going through
      cancer. They provide amazing opportunities for us to get out, live life,
      and forget about cancer for a few hours."

      "The Making Memories program has motivated me and my family to prioritize
      making memories together, even when I'm not feeling well. We are so
      grateful not to have to worry about financial concerns of social outings
      when so much else is uncertain."

      <p>"Cancer can be all-consuming when you are feeling overwhelmed by nausea
      and fatigue. The Making Memories events allow for low-key family time and
      a chance to connect with others who are in the same situation. Thank
      you!"</p>

      <p>"Words cannot express how much that Emergency Financial Assistance
      grant made a difference in my life. I had already fallen behind on a
      couple of bills, causing me to feel stressed. Your grant took away the
      stress and gave me peace knowing that I was able to drastically lower the
      amounts I owed. Thank you for being there just when I needed you
      most."</p>
