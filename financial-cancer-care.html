      - question: >-
          What is the Financial Cancer Care Program, and how can it help cancer
          patients?
        answer_html: >-
          <p>Financial Cancer Care provides cancer patients and their loved ones
          with personalized financial guidance and support. The program helps
          patients navigate the financial complexities of cancer care by
          offering tailored advice and connecting them to resources that ease
          the financial burden. If a patient is unable to attend a workshop or
          session, their loved ones are welcome to participate on their behalf.
          This ensures that everyone involved in the patient's care has access
          to the support needed to make informed decisions about finances and
          resources.</p>
