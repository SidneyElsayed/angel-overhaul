          <p>Financial Cancer Care provides cancer patients and their loved ones

          the financial burden. If a patient is unable to attend a workshop or
          session, their loved ones are welcome to participate on their behalf.
          This ensures that everyone involved in the patient's care has access
          to the support needed to make informed decisions about finances and
          resources.</p>
