          I have a profile from applying to another Angel Foundation™ program
          (Emergency Financial Assistance, Financial Cancer Care, Angel Packs™).
          Do I need to start a new one?
        answer_html: >-
          <p>No, please use your existing profile. You can apply to any of our
          programs using that profile.</p>
      - question: I do not remember if I completed an application. How can I check?
        answer_html: >-
          <p>Log in to your portal <a

          title="Login Portal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow

          application, you will see a box that says “+ Get Started.” If you have
          completed an application, the box will say your name with “Completed”
          or “Approved” under it.</p>
      - question: >-
          I completed an application to attend an event in the past. Do I need
          to complete another one for the next event?
        answer_html: >-
          <p>No. One application covers all Adult &amp; Family Programs.
          However, a separate registration form is required for each Making
          Memories or Educational Program. Instructions to complete registration
          for an Adult &amp; Family Programs event are available <a
          href="/Registration-PDF.pdf" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
      - question: I’m trying to register for an event and am having trouble. Help!
        answer_html: >-
          <p>Please follow the process described <a href="/Registration-PDF.pdf"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here.</strong></a> If you still
          need help, call 612-627-9000 or email programs@mnangel.org.</p>
      - question: >-
          If my family visits an area where a Making Memories event is planned,
          but we don’t live nearby, can we still attend?
        answer_html: >-
          <p>A key goal of our Adult &amp; Family programs is to help
          participants connect with their local cancer communities. We ask that
          you only attend events in the area where you live or receive treatment
          (e.g., Duluth events are for St. Louis County residents or those
          treated in Duluth). Family Camp Angel, Family Camp Snow Angel, and
          virtual events are open to all, regardless of location.</p>

  // 1) like all js lets start with our constants. As this is nice efficient code we we just have the one.  
  // this is defining all our buttons
  const buttons = document.querySelectorAll(".expandButton");

  // This is a function that find the element that was clicked then finds the next child of its parent and removes the class of hidden
    // 2) lets start our function that we want to use to show more
  function showMore() {

      //5) now we get to something new :D we are going to target an element based off of it's position relative to the triggering element. 
      
      console.log(this.previousElementSibling);
      console.log(this.nextElementSibling);

      // 6) using this we can target the section we want to appear and toggle the hidden class :D 
      this.nextElementSibling.classList.toggle('hidden');
  }

    // 3) next we want to loop over all of our buttons using that classic forEach method
  buttons.forEach(button =>
      // 4) and add an event listener to each of them that triggers our function
      button.addEventListener('click', showMore)
