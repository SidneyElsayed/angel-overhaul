      Founded in 2001 under the name "Minnesota Oncology Hematology Foundation,"
      we began by providing immediate financial relief to cancer patients for
      basic, nonmedical expenses. Since then, we have changed our name to Angel
      Foundation™ and expanded our services to include education and social
      events for families impacted by cancer, resource navigation, financial
      guidance, therapeutic kits to help kids understand cancer, peer-to-peer
      support, and more.

      <p>Mark and Margie Sborov met in high school through their friend, Jim,
      who died of leukemia at 16. Jim's death profoundly affected them both,
      leading Mark to become an Oncologist and Margie a Patient Navigator. In
      2001, they founded Angel Foundation™ to help cancer patients with
      immediate nonmedical expenses. Since then, Angel Foundation™ has provided
      over $15 million in direct financial assistance and served 58,000 cancer
      patients.</p>
