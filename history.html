      Founded in 2001, Angel Foundation™ began by providing immediate financial
      relief to cancer patients for basic, nonmedical expenses. Since then, we
      have expanded to offer education and social events for families impacted
      by cancer, resource navigation, financial guidance, therapeutic kits to
      help kids understand cancer, peer-to-peer support, and more.

      <p>Mark and Margie Sborov met in high school through their friend, Jim,
      who died of leukemia at 16. Jim's death profoundly affected them both,
      leading Mark to become an Oncologist and Margie a Patient Navigator. In
      2001, they founded Angel Foundation™ to help cancer patients with
      immediate nonmedical expenses. Since then, Angel Foundation™ has provided
      over $15 million in direct financial assistance and served 58,000 cancer
      patients.</p>
