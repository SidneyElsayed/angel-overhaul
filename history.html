      In 2001, Angel Foundation™ was established to provide immediate financial
      relief to cancer patients struggling to cover their basic, nonmedical
      expenses. Since then, we have expanded our services to offer education and
      social events for families impacted by cancer, resource navigation,
      financial guidance, therapeutic kits to help kids understand what cancer
      is and how it is treated, peer-to-peer support, and more.

      <p>Mark and Margie Sborov met in high school through their friend, Jim,
      who died of leukemia at 16 years old. Jim's death profoundly affected Mark
      and Margie, who both went on to work in the field of oncology, Mark as an
      Oncologist and Margie as a Patient Navigator. In 2001, they founded Angel
      Foundation™ to help cancer patients with immediate nonmedical expenses.
      Since then, Angel Foundation™ has provided over $15 Million in direct
      financial assistance and served 58,000 cancer patients.</p>
